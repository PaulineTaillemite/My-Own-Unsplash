# 🌦️ My Unsplash App

## 🌐 Overview
My Unsplash App is a personal project developed during my studies at Ada Tech School. The aim was to create a very minimalist (but efficient) website that displays a selection of random pictures from a theme wrote by the user in the home input. I considered this project as a challenge to improve my JS and CSS skills, fetching the Unsplash Api.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🌐 HTML
- 📜 JavaScript (JS)
- 🎨 Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

## 🌟 Features
The primary goal of this project was to apply the knowledge I have gained in JS (fetching and looping) and CSS (hover and hidden). 

## 🚧 Challenges
One of the challenges encountered was to manage the display of each pictures'data not one by one, but using JS loop method.

For example :
